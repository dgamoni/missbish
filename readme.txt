This field will be an ACF field called "Annotated Product Image".
You will create a table in ACF to add annotations, and allow the user to drag drop points on the image to set the coordinates for each annotation.
Each annotation will link to a woo commerce product.
You will store multiple the x/y coordinates, and productIds for the field.
The annotations will be done for 1 image size (eg. 400px * 400px ), based on which we can place the 'crosses' on the image responsively on the front end.
